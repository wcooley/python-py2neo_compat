=======

1.0.4 (2025-07-01)
------------------

-   Don\'t use [six.create_bound_method]{.title-ref} to attach
    [to_dict]{.title-ref} to classes.

1.0.3 (2025-05-25)
------------------

-   Add graph/graph_db compatibility mapping.
-   Bind \'to_dict\' to property classes, so rather than being short and
    ambiguous or long and obnoxious, it can just be called like a normal
    method.

-   Drop Python 2.7 support.
